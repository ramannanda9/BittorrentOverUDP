Testing Strategy
1.1 Clumsy was used to simulate network packet loss, lag, and other scenarios. It can be downloaded here https://jagt.github.io/clumsy/. Start and Select UDP option or type udp in the command.
1.2 Various combinations of scenarios were executed and some of them have been mentioned in project design specification.
1.3 Resources to test the code are present in the test directory of the root folder.
1.4 Following commands can be used to startup 2 peers each containing different sets of chunks

java -jar peer.jar -f files/C.masterchunks -c files/A.haschunks -i 3 -d 2 -p nodes.map -m 3
java -jar peer.jar -f files/C.masterchunks -c files/B.haschunks -i 2 -d 2 -p nodes.map -m 3
java -jar peer.jar -f files/C.masterchunks -c files/B.haschunks -i 4 -d 2 -p nodes.map -m 3
java -jar peer.jar -f files/C.masterchunks -c files/A.haschunks -i 6 -d 2 -p nodes.map -m 4

Then a command for download can be issued at each of the peers. 

1.5 *****All the chunk outputs and problem files are created in the temporary directory of the OS, so files have to be looked up from there. This is to ensure that we have write permission to write to the directory location. *****
